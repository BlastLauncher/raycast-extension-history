Or generate a fresh list from your local Raycast extensions:

./generate_extensions.sh
```

## How It Works

- A GitHub Action runs weekly to scan the official [Raycast Extensions Repository](https://github.com/raycast/extensions)
- For each extension, it records the timestamp of its first commit
- The data is stored in a simple text format: `<timestamp> <extension_path>`
- The list is published to the `extensions-list` branch

## Requirements

For local usage:
- bash
- git
- fzf (for interactive viewing)
